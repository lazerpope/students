Shipman Mikaela Krantz (As a child)\n\n\n\nHiro (\u30d2\u30ed, Hiro) is the main
protagonist of DARLING in the FRANXX. He was a Parasite with the codename
\"016\" and was once known as a prodigy among the Children. However, he failed
to synchronize with his partner Naomi and was considered nothing but a failure
as a pilot. As a result, he did not know where he belonged and struggled to find
his place in the world. However, upon being partnered and piloting with Zero
Two, he became an official Parasite and found a new reason to live. Hiro and
Zero Two were the newest members of the 13th Plantation, piloting a FRANXX
called Strelizia.\nOver the time spent together he began to reproduce feelings
of romance with Zero Two, and when their relationship as partners began to take
a turn and slowly crumble, he reawakened his previous feelings during childhood
with her, along with his current feelings of love. The two eventually began a
relationship together before their demise. Although motivated to fulfil his duty
as a parasite, he later makes it his purpose in life to free all the parasites
from APE\u2019s control and he selflessly sacrifices his own life to protect his
friends and the planet.\nA thousand years later, Hiro and Zero Two's souls
reincarnate as a pair of children that meet each other again and rekindle their
romance.\n\nContents\n\n1 Appearance\n2 Personality\n3 History\n\n3.1 Episode

Gallery\n8 Quotes\n9 Trivia\n10 References\n\n\nAppearance\nHiro had an average
build, height, and a standard \"slim\" male physique. He had black, shaggy hair
and rich blue eyes. His checkered past had left him with an emphatic expression
on his face. He was often seen in the standard Stamen uniform which consists of
a white collared top with formal long grey sleeves and a matching grey
midsection, while the chest area is colored navy blue with the respective
Parasites cadet badge pinned on the left side, which is separated with an
upside-down Y shaped pin-like embellishment on the center which is exclusive for
male Parasites only, on the back of the uniform a white pinstriped
diamond-shaped patch is seen between the shoulder blades. The uniform is paired
with light-grey mid-length high-waisted shorts stopping just above the knees
which has symmetrical two black buttons on the stomach area, and dark garter
socks held by a pair of black straps around the calf, brown shoes and
ankle-length black socks which seems to wrap around the shoes by the corner.\n\n
Hiro's tumor which emerged after his second time piloting with Zero Two.
\nStarting from Episode 05, he had a blue tumor-like mutation in his chest,
caused by piloting with Zero Two, which increased his yellow blood cell count,
the polar opposite of what happened when Zero Two rode with other parasites.
This mutation later grew larger due to piloting with Zero Two again, however
Hiro was able to overcome the mutation using his willpower, and completely got
rid of it, although a scar was left on his chest.\n\n Hiro's appearance after
his fully completed saurification. \nStarting from Episode 14, Hiro developed
canines and he also began sprouting small blue horns due to his
\"saurification\". His horns eventually began to lengthen significantly and glow
blue, the same way Zero Two's do when emotionally agitated. His eyes become
luminescent, changing from a dark blue-green to bright blue. His irises also
gained more blue hues and rings, and he also developed a blue eyeliner similar
to Zero Two's. His fangs grew out when he was enraged. Right before his demise,
Hiro was shown to have blue skin, similar to that of the
klaxo-sapiens.\n\nPersonality\nAs a child, Hiro was very jovial, optimistic, and
hopeful, giving names to other kids and to himself as well. He taught the kids
that names only given to themselves could give a sense of uniqueness when the
only name they had was their codes. This earned him fame among other children,
even those in other plantations. Because of this, he was chosen to represent the
Children in the Garden.[2] During his time at the Garden, Hiro was very curious
about himself and the world around him. He would constantly ask himself
questions and whenever he tried to ask the adults, they would never give him an
answer. This, coupled with the fact that the other Children never took a stand
with him and were very obedient, made Hiro frustrated and he felt like he was
the only person fighting the world all by himself. This changed when he met Zero
Two, to which Hiro realized that there were other people fighting the world by
themselves. He was then shown to be tenacious and brave, as he didn't bother to
wait to rescue Zero Two and broke her out of her room and helped her evade the
authorities for a while all by himself. However, after getting caught, the
authorities decided to erase both of their memories: Hiro's curiosity,
free-spirited nature, and meeting with Zero Two were few of the reasons why.[3]
After this, Hiro became less curious, joyful and creative, and more emphatic,
serious and obedient. He also stopped naming children and was stripped off of
some of the original aspects of his personality. Prior of his memory wipe, Hiro
only wanted to pilot in as much as it would let him leave the Garden, but when
this motivation was erased from his memory, piloting was all he remembered and
his sole purpose for living.\nBecause he was considered a role model, all of the
children hoped he would lead them because he was the best pilot, but Hiro's
aptitude skill began to dip after he ingested a young Zero Two's blood. This
inability to pilot a FRANXX had left his hopes low, even to the point of
choosing to leave the Thirteenth Plantation until his former partner Naomi
encouraged him to stay. Losing the ability to pilot had left him with extremely
low self-confidence and left a insecure feeling that his life had little worth.
He initially struggled to find somewhere to belong, even to the extent that he
was more than willing to ride with Zero Two even if it meant death. Part of the
reason why he was determined to keep on piloting Strelizia is because he was
finally able to fulfill his role as a Parasite, and he was willing to die
fighting than live as a useless civilian.[4] However, this wish of his came to
an end after he survived his third ride with Zero Two. It was then he realized
that he had found another reason to fight beside protecting Papa and the adults:
to become Zero Two's wings.[5]\nHiro appears to be quite philosophical, as he
was first introduced as him monologuing about the philosophical meaning of a
wounded bird he saw in the forest, indicating that he still had retained the
curiosity of the outside world from his childhood. In his time in the Garden, he
spent his time teaching Ichigo and Goro about many old but meaningful sayings
that would stick to them even as they grew up.[6]\nHiro was shown to be very
hardworking and devoted, as he refused to stop piloting with Zero Two and when
he trained in a FRANXX training unit all day and all night so he could be useful
and fight alongside the other Parasites. He was also kind and caring, as despite
feeling depressed over his inability to pilot, he never acted in a harsh manner
towards his fellow pilots, even when some of them weren't as welcoming towards
him. However, he was more than willing to fight back when Zorome antagonized him
several times. He was determined to prove himself worthy to pilot and make
himself acknowledged. When he got promoted to an official Parasite, he states
that he would do his best and not tie them down. After regaining his memories,
Hiro regains his former personality. Also, thanks to Zero Two's influence and
his bonds with people, he understood that there were more to life than just to
pilot a FRANXX. He also began thinking about the future and all the possible
paths that were open for all of them. He teaches all of this to his friends in
Squad 13.[7] Instead of the \"fight until I die\" mentality, Hiro developed a
\"fight so I can keep living\" mentality.[8] His traits from childhood also
started to resurface: he became fearless, disobedient, rebellious and ready to
stand up for his friends, even it meant going against the rules. This is seen
where when Papa and the others destroyed Squad 13's happy and peaceful life,
especially in regard to Mitsuru and Kokoro's memories being erased due to their
decision to get married, Hiro told Papa that he would never see him as their
\u2018papa\u2019 nor obey him ever again after what he did to his two friends,
insisting that the Parasites would be free from APE after their final battle. He
became increasingly adamant about gaining freedom for himself, Zero Two and
their teammates. Hiro also develops a strong dislike towards those who hurt his
friends; and he told Dr. FRANXX he will never forgive him for the torturous
treatment he put Zero Two through, and felt disdain towards the 9\u2019s for
their interface of Squad 13\u2019s personal lives and frequent mocking of them.
Nevertheless, Hiro is willing to set gue. Hiro again tries to restrain her and
rationalizes that it is impossible for her to become human. Zero Two violently
resists him, causing Strelizia to go stampede mode and she begins stranglin
Hiro, saying she is going to become a human and find her darling from before.
Hiro connects too deep into her consciousness and he receives visions of a past
long forgotten.\n\nEpisode 13\nNana warns that Hiro's and Zero Two's
consciousnesses will connect through Strelizia and merge. Hiro receives long
forgotten memories from when he was a child living in the Garden and was curious
of the outside world, and how this provoked him into helping Zero Two escape
before they were captured and their memories were erased.\nIn the present,
Delphinium's arm is ripped off and tackles Strelizia to the ground. Ichigo yells
for Hiro to get away from Zero Two or he'd lose his humanity. Hiro, crying, says
that she was the girl with the picture book. She looks back at him with tears in
her eyes.\n\nEpisode 14\nHiro remembers Zero Two as the girl with the picture
book from his childhood and he asks how could he forget something so important.
Zero Two catches Hiro before he collapses and asks if he's her darling from her
childhood and is horrified thinking of what she had done. Ichigo suddenly
interrupts and throws her off of him and into Goro. He asks if she's alright as
Ichigo tries to revive Hiro. The other FRANXX wait. When they return to the
docking facility, Hiro is taken for treatment. Zero Two realizes what Hiro meant
when he said he wanted to understand her better.\nHiro wakes up and is
surrounded by his teammates. He asks where Zero Two is and Ichigo says she
stopped her. Hiro has strangulation marks on his neck. They all leave, but Hiro
stops Mitsuru.\nHiro says that he made a promise to him before he got an Elixer
Injection. Mitsuru is surprised, but says to never mind and it was a long time
ago. He says he'd forgotten about it before that. He says that any other stamen
would've died long ago. He tells him to listen to Ichigo and stay away from her.
Hiro says that he has something to ask her and thanks Mitsuru.\nHe says that
after that day, his aptitude kept decreasing. Though he felt like he died, she
gave him a new life. He thinks it must be because he drank her blood.\nWhen Hiro
gets up, he is stopped by Miku. Zero Two is also guarded and prevented from
leaving her room. Ichigo comes in to see Hiro and they chat. She gives him an
apple. She tells him that Zero Two is returning to the 9's the next night. She
asks if he hates her and says that, even if he does, not to go anywhere. Hiro
apologizes and Ichigo cuts her thumb, so Hiro bandages it for her. Ichigo leaves
the knife and apple peels. Zero Two breaks out of her room as Ichigo returns.
Hiro unknowingly goes to Zero Two's room.\nHe asks through the door if she knew
about their past. He opens the door to find the room destroyed. He returns to
the hospital to find all his teammates unconscious and her attacking Ichigo.
Zero Two, with a devious grin, invites Hiro to \"talk lots and lots\". Hiro
scolds her for being such a monster. She realizes the damage she'd done to
him.\nZero Two leaves the plantation as the other parasites watch her leave
silently. She passes by Hiro without saying anything. When Ichigo suggests they
go inside, she finds that he's crying. He is about to go after her, but Ichigo
stops him, saying he'll turn into a monster. When he turns away again, she grabs
his face and kisses him.\nIchigo says she doesn't regret the kiss they shared
during the mock battle and that she wants to be with him forever. Ichigo says
that he'd always been her everything and that she'd never been interested in
anyone else. He looks up to see Zero Two's ship.\n\nEpisode 15\nAt Cerasus's
international briefing room, Hachi explains that their objective is to take
control of Gran Crevasse. Though another group is attacking, they aren't making
headway. Squad 13 is to group up with squads from other plantations.\nKokoro
asks what Gran Crevasse is. Nana shows them a video where a large amount of
klaxosaur are. Hachi explains that taking over Gran Crevasse is Papa's
long-standing wish and would be a turning point in humanity's history. On
screen, a large group of FRANXX walk behind Strelizia in it's stampede mode.\nAt
APE central HQ on Cosmos, Dr. FRANXX meets with the council. He finds that Zero
Two devoured all of her stamen and he calls her a hellcat.\nHiro watches Zero
Two attack a klaxosaur. Ichigo suddenly grabs his hand and squeezes, but doesn't
look up at him.\nThe parasites of Chrysanthemum struggle against the klaxosaurs
large numbers. 090 screams when one of his squadmates is almost killed.
Strelizia kills it, saving the FRANXX, and 9'\u03b1 appears to take out more of
them. He compliments 090 saying he did well for humans. He says they'll take
over, so they can go in the rear.\nIn Cerasus's command room, they receive a
message from mission command saying they're prepared to sortie. Nana tells the
kids to get ready. The parasites all walk away to battle. Goro tells him not to
be sad, because they'll be fine. Ichigo says that she'll teach him how to pilot
from the ground up once she gets back. He asks them to come back alive, and they
smile at him.\nThe 6th united FRANXX company begins marching together. The 9's
take out a bunch of klaxosaur. Ichigo is amazed, saying it's like having a bunch
of Strelizias. 9'\u03b1 says that there's a lot of them. 9'\u03b2 points out
Plantation 13 fighting. He jumps behind Ichigo and says that her FRANXX is
adorable. She sarcastically thanks him. He says that they're holding them off
fine, but they're not making any progress and that the Crevasse has been sealed
off inside a thick dome. They need to strike from the inside to get rid of it.
Hiro sadly watches from the control room.\nThe unit takes out many klaxosaurs
and Unit 26 notes that they're fighting well. 090 notes that they're still all
over the place, but he's happy they're there. He tells them to regroup. They are
about to enter the hole in the wall, but the klaxosaur all flee. The control
room detects magma energy readings underground ascertained to be super
lehmann-class klaxosaur. Dr. FRANXX walks in and is amazed that it was hidden
underground. Hachi says he never heard of that class.\nAs it comes from
underground, it pushes the plantation on its side and it begins to break. 090
reacts in horror as his home is destroyed. Vice Chairman says to get 090 on the
line and tells him they're moving to Protocol 32. He tells him that it's a great
honour. The klaxosaur moves toward plantation 13. Unit 26 lines up with bombs.
He whispers that they're counting on 13 now before the squad explodes. It stops,
but its face smashes through the wall and it releases klaxosaur inside. Zero Two
runs in and begins attacking. The adults say that they have to neutralize the
Super Lehmann-Class and Papa and the rest will take care of Gran Crevasse. Nana
says that Dr. FRANXX should return to HQ and Hiro to Misilteinn. Dr. FRANXX asks
if he finds her more beautiful than any human, pure, proud, and more alone than
anyone like a klaxosaur. Hiro says that she isn't a klaxosaur. He says that he
thought she had finally found a partner and Hiro goes up to Misilteinn.\nThe
FRANXX struggle against their large numbers. Zero Two takes out a large amount
of klaxosaurs. 9'\u03b2 says that she's in a foul mood. 9'\u03b1 says that the
thought of getting on that unseemly beast's bad side gives him the chills.\nIn
Zero Two's room, he finds scratches and blood on the wall. In front of the
window, he finds Naomi's mirror, which Zero Two taped back together after
breaking it. Gulping, he asks himself why he's holding back.\nKokoro says that
they're being pushed back. Chlorophytum runs out of ammo, so they use a pillar
to attack. Argentea is pushed back, and the Old Woman watches it walk forward
from her window. Ichigo watches Strelizia and Goro tries to get her to focus.
They notice a training unit zip by them, as does Argentea. They realize it's
Hiro. The training unit is taken out, so Delphinium stops him and says that he
won't let him see her. Goro suddenly stops. He says he can't stand watching Hiro
and Zero Two like that anymore. He steps out and tells Hiro to get in. He says
that Hiro has something to say and Ichigo is worried about her too, so he asks
her to take him to Zero Two.\nHiro apologizes to Ichigo and they begin to
connect. Finally connecting to him, Ichigo is disappointed to find that all his
memories are of Zero Two. She cries as they head out. Smiling, Goro quietly
wishes them good luck. Argentea picks him up and Zorome and Miku ask what he's
acting so cool for.\nZero Two thinks she was human, though she pretended, she
wished to become one. Ichigo charges towards her. She begins attacking and says
that she's sick of how she always toys with her. After Strelizia breaks her
spear, Delphinium slaps her and says she wishes she'd never known her. She
breaks her helmet and Ichigo says to get her act together as she headbutts
her.\nAs the door opens, he finds that her horns have grown and branched and her
eyes are red. He says that he came to see her. Ichigo says to protect Strelizia
since it's the only one that can kill the monster.\nAs Genista and Argentea
attack klaxosaurs, one of the cores crack in half and something falls out of the
center. Ikuno says it looks like a human. Suddenly, there is an explosion. As it
is announced that the backup plan is almost complete, Papa says that they can
let the plantation go now. The stamen of the plantation are confused as to why
they're making in plantations self-destruct. 9'\u03b5 and 9'a says that they're
planning to end things without Strelizia's help. Dr. FRANXX is disgusted with
their choice.\nHiro tries to connect, but he gets no response. He holds her
horns and asks to be taken to her. A man says that, though 016's memories were
erased, 002's couldn't be completely erased. The doctor tells them to continue
to try and erase, regardless of the effects on her and orders Hiro back to the
garden. He says that he's probably useless now that he ingested her blood.\nShe
cannot remember things, but begins to when she recognizes familiar actions. She
licks her wounds in a similar way. Seeing her book, she begins eating it. She
learns the word \"boku\" and Zero Two, and \"darling.\" She remembers him
getting attacked and begins crying.\nZero Two's horns break and Hiro hugs her.
She pushes him away and tells him not to look at her. They apologize and cry
holding each other. He says they can see the world together and kisses her as
she cries. Strelizia attacks and transforms into a red version of it and easily
takes out the klaxosaur. They confess their love for each other. Futoshi and
Zorome cry and Ichigo says she's happy for them. The 9's begin attacking as
well. The sages say that the door to Gran Crevasse has been opened and the day
of humanity's liberation is upon them.\nInside the mountain klaxosaur, they find
that its core is a collective mass of cores. A large hand suddenly shoots up
from the ground. 9'a laughs and says that it reacted quickly. It smashes a
majority of the plantation, leaving Mistiltein.\n\nEpisode 16\nMitsuru and Hiro
inspect Cerasus' water sources. Mitsuru says that it's turning foul as well.
Hiro says they should try and filter it. Mitsuru says that their water supply
could stop at anytime as he stands up. They're interrupted when Zero Two bangs
on the pot and says that breakfast is ready.\nIchigo serves up their rations.
When Zorome complains, Ichigo takes his rations and says he doesn't have to eat
it. Ikuno enters and offers to help, but Ichigo says that it's fine and asks if
her fever went down. Zero Two places her forehead on Ikuno and says that she's
36.7 degrees (a normal body temperature) but tells her not to push
herself.\nThey pray for Papa before they eat, though Zero Two eats anyway. Zero
Two lists off the chores and Miku, smiling, notes that she's meticulous. As the
stamen eat, Futoshi stops. Hiro asks if he's okay. Futoshi lies and says he's
dieting. Zorome laughs and pinches his stomach, saying he isn't cut out for
it.\nGoro says it's been a month as he and Hiro look at the cans. Hiro asks if
he wants to get back in the FRANXX. Goro says that, even though they were
fighting and could die anytime, not fighting makes them all fidgety too. He says
that he thought Hiro was the most obsessed piloting the FRANXX.\nHiro and Zero
Two walk together. Hiro says that Goro must have gotten child fever last week.
Zero Two curiously looks at a plant. Hiro explains that they're sakura buds. He
says that they're a really pretty color, like her hair. She giggles and says she
wants to see them.\nHe asks how she felt about their lives and she says they're
having fun and would like to live like that forever. He scooches closer to her
and is about to hold her hand, but she suddenly remembers that she was supposed
to go bathing with the other pistils. She tells him not to peek.\nThe parasites
meet in their living room and Ichigo says that they have five sources they can
use for drinking water. Mitsuru says that only two of them are only usable with
filtering. Ikuno asks if they can repair the circulation system themselves. Hiro
says that Mistilteinn doesn't have the equipment. Futoshi says that their access
to the elevator is restricted too. Zorome asks why they don't send a letter to
Papa and ask him to fix it. Goro says that he doesn't think there'd be a point.
The parasites sadly reflect on their vulnerability, so Zero Two says that they
should cook their own food.\nHiro agrees with her, and Mitsuru agrees with him,
remarking how there are cookbooks in the library. Kokoro says that maybe they
could do it then. They all agree, except for Zorome who pouts.\nWhen Futoshi
starts a fire, he tries to show Zorome. Zorome asks if he's not dieting. He
eventually becomes enthused as well. Miku and Ikuno make dough. Kokoro makes a
salad and Mitsuru reads a cooking book. Ichigo welcomes Hiro, Goro, and Zero Two
back from fishing. Zorome and the rest are impressed with the 11 fish that she
caught. Goro caught 9 and Hiro, awkwardly smiled and scratched his head, saying
he didn't catch any. Zero Two says she'll teach him later. The others want to
try fishing as well.\nBefore they eat, they all marvel at how they were able to
cook. Though Ichigo's about to pray, Zorome starts eating and says why should
they when they did everything themselves. He says it's good as Miku tries
Kokoro's salad. When she says it's good, Kokoro is happy and she and Mitsuru
smile at each other.\nZorome is happy at what they've accomplished and tries to
get Futoshi to eat. Futoshi accidentally drops the food and Mitsuru asks if he's
okay. As he picks glass, Zorome tells him to quit forcing himself. Zorome begins
helping. He says that he knows Futoshi is forcing himself to eat and throwing it
back up. Though Futoshi denies it, Zorome grabs his collar and begins crying. He
says he has to eat to survive. Futoshi forces himself to eat and Hiro puts his
hand on his back.\nZorome asks why Papa isn't getting in touch as he cries. Miku
begins crying as well.\nMitsuru says that as pilots, there's a limit to their
lives. Miku cries as she says that she was worried too, but too scared to speak
up. Ikuno and Goro agree. Goro says that he'd been writing to Nana and Hachi to
let them know how they're doing, but they never accepted them. Hiro says it's
fine if they were cast aside by Papa as long as he's with them and there's more
to their lives than piloting. Futoshi starts crying and says he's hungry. They
all laugh and Zorome says he suits being fat.\nThat night, Zero Two draws
pictures in her room of the book they read together. When Hiro says that it's a
sad story, she says that it was her first \"pretty thing.\" She met him and
wanted to have something beautiful with him. She realizes now what it means to
be human and they embrace. She hears a klaxosaur scream as another horned girl
is shown.\n\nEpisode 17\n9'\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5 stand at
the door. Ichigo asks why they're there. 9'\u03b1 says they came to check on
Papa's orders and that he had been worried sick about them. This is a great
relief to Zorome and Miku. 9'\u03b2 notes the problems in their environment and
9'\u03b3 agrees. 9'\u03b1 asks for them to ready rooms for them. Ichigo is
surprised that they intend to stay there, and he smiles and says that he'd taken
a liking to them.\nIchigo is surprised to hear that all the surviving squads had
been gathered in one place and sadly asks why they were the only ones left out.
9'\u03b3 says that it wasn't what Papa wanted and that Hachi and Nana should
have told them about it.\nMiku cries while eating, and 9'\u03b4 asks why.
Smiling, she says that she's just relieved that they weren't left there to die.
Zorome throws his arm over 9'\u03b2 shoulders and encourages him to eat, though
he politely refuses his offer.\nIchigo says that she assumed that they were
there to take Zero Two back. 9'\u03b5 laughs and says they aren't her
babysitters but her squad mates. Even though she didn't seem pleased to see
them.\nZero Two looks at the flame of a candle in her room when Hiro calls out
to her. He asks about her flower headband. She says that Miku made it for her.
She shyly tells him not to stare, but says it's okay after he compliments
her.\nZero Two pushes his bangs back to reveal small blue horns poking through
his forehead. She says that they'd grown bigger. She thinks that they must be
because he rode with her or because she drank his blood. She sadly says that she
drastically altered his destiny. He leans in and places his horns against her's.
They kiss and rest their foreheads against each other. Blushing, Hiro says that
it makes him happy to be more similar to her.\nShe tells him that she ate her
old picture book when they were trying to erase her memories. She says that she
started wanting to become human because she wanted to see him again and she was
told that she could do that by killing klaxosaurs, though she realizes she
shouldn't have believed them. Hiro asks if Papa and the rest told her, but she
doesn't answer.\nShe asks that he show her the picture he drew. He refuses, so
she playfully snatches it from him. She finds that he crudely drew a picture of
a king. She begins laughing and he covers his face in embarrassment. She says
that it's approved and she loves it as she holds it against her chest.\nThe next
day, as Mitsuru stands motionless at a body of water, Hiro appears and they
enter the water together. Mitsuru says he doesn't understand what Kokoro's
thinking. Hiro smiles and says that he's changed. Before he'd only distanced
himself from them. Though Hiro says that it was all his fault for breaking their
promise. He says that he's probably in love with Kokoro, since he has similar
feelings for Zero Two as he does for Kokoro. Mitsuru thinks to his self that he
is in love with her. He says he can't be sure, but that it how it's for him as
he stands up. Mitsuru stands as well and says that he's similar to Hiro and he's
glad that he could have a nice chat with him after so long.\nWhen Hiro and
Mitsuru enter the living room, Miku says that he's there. Smiling, Ichigo says
that Zorome told them about him and Kokoro. Ikuno says that she's not surprised.
Zorome angrily explains that he just asked if a boy and a girl getting all
clingy was the cool thing to do. Miku tells him to be quiet. Futoshi suddenly
grabs Mitsuru's collar and asks if they'd kissed. Kokoro looks down,
embarrassed, and they realizes they had. This upsets Futoshi and begins to say
that, if they're happy but is interrupted with the 9's entering the
room.\n9'\u03b1 holds up the childbirth handbook and asks if they recognize it.
With Kokoro and Mitsuru's reaction, he says that they do. He asks for an
explanation from Kokoro, since she's the one who dropped it. He says that it's
strange, since it wouldn't have been provided in the study there, and it doesn't
belong to her. Kokoro apologizes for not telling them all.\nShe turns to her
squad and says she wants to make a baby. This confuses the other parasites.
9'\u03b1 smiles and says that Papa had banned that. Zorome says that it sounds
bad and Goro asks Mitsuru if she said anything, and he fidgets
uncomfortably.\nKokoro turns back to the nines and asks if it's so bad since
it's how all humans were born. Futoshi asks if Papa didn't create them. She says
they were born like any other animal and it had always been like that for all
living things. She says that's why they have boys and girls. She says that she
wants to leave something behind before she's gone. She happily explains that
their purpose in life isn't just to ride FRANXX and that they could carry new
lives and leave them for the future. She says that it made her happy to hear
that, but she is interrupted by 9'a calling her disgusting. When she turns to
him, he says that she's disgusting.\nHe explains that humans have evolved and
cast their reproductive functions aside in the process. Reject that, and they
all have to go back to conforming to one gender. He asks if gender isn't just a
pain that's tolerated to operate the FRANXX. Kokoro has tears in her eyes and
Mitsuru begins to say something, but Ikuno suddenly walks up and slaps him.
9'\u03b3 whistles and the other nines seem surprised, as is Ichigo. Ikuno asks
what it matters if it's a pain. alpha says that humans have also cast away their
tendency to be ruled by emotions like her since it serves no purpose. He smiles
and tells them to look at themselves, though.\nIkuno begins to walk up to him,
but is pulled back by Goro and Ichigo. Nana and Hachi appear and ask them to
stop.\nMitsuru sits alone in the greenhouse, thinking. In the living room,
Futoshi says that Kokoro is taking a long time to return. Miku says she had no
idea she was thinking about that and wishes she would have told her. Ikuno looks
down and says that everyone has things they can't talk about. Miku asks if they
think they really can make babies. Zorome says he has no idea and Goro wonders
how they were born if Papa didn't create them and asks what Hiro thinks. He says
he doesn't know, but that they may have the potential to do something Papa
hadn't told them about. They reflect that they may be able to leave something
for the future. Smiling, Zero Two says she's envious, since she can't leave
something behind. She calls them all wonderful since they have the ability to
decide their futures themselves.\nIkuno narrates that everything comes to an end
eventually. The only difference is whether it happens sooner or later. As for
what comes after, they know nothing.\nZero Two shows Hiro a picture of a queen
that she drew in her room. Ikuno sits on the porch with her head on her hands.
Mitsuru and Kokoro lie naked in each other's arms after consummating their
relationship.\nPapa and the Vice Chairman sit on Cosmos and Papa says that the
klaxosaur princess chose to go down the path of annihilation. The Vice Chairman
says they'll feel the pain of having their earth scorched by their own creation.
The Nines that visited the 13th Plantation appear and 9'\u03b1 says there's
something he needs to know.\n\nEpisode 18\nWhile Ichigo speaks to Hachi about
the squad\u2019s inevitable departure from Mistilteinn, Goro holds his head and
Hiro asks how his fever is. He smiles and says fine. Hiro says that Miku had her
fever recently as well. Ichigo comes out and Goro asks what's wrong. In the
elevator, she tells the two of their plans to abandon Mistilteinn. Though she
wants to stay, Goro says that they don't have enough rations and Mistilteinn
won't last very long in itself. As they walk back, Goro says that their life
there wasn't all bad. Ichigo says it's sad that they have to leave. Hiro says
there's something he'd like them to do while they're still there.\nHiro explains
to the parasites that he wants to have a wedding. As they don't know what it is,
Hiro explains that it was a ceremony where two people would make a vow together.
Miku asks who will get married. Hiro says Kokoro and Mitsuru. Kokoro says that
Hiro told them about it and it sounded wonderful. Mitsuru says they decided to
do it before leaving. Goro, Miku, and Zorome voice their support. Though they
stop to check on Futoshi, he exclaims that he wants to play the priest so he can
be right beside Kokoro and Mitsuru to congratulate them. Kokoro thanks
him.\nZorome kicks a ball around as Futoshi and Hiro set up chairs. The sakura
petals are blown in the wind. Zorome kicks the ball to Hiro and the three pass
it back and forth. Miku comes out and scolds them.\nThe parasites paint the side
of the house. Ichigo bring Ikuno out and they all pose for a picture.\nZero Two
looks at her mirror and headband. She is about to draw something, but stops and
looks at the drawings for her book. She hears screaming and a black hole appears
in the ground. Stamen, such as 081, climb out of the hole and pull at her. The
large hand is about to strike her, but she is woken up by Hiro. He asks if she's
okay and she shakes in his chest. She smiles and says she dozed off. Hiro says
her books almost complete, and she smiles and says she'll show it to him when
she's done.\nThe next morning, Zero Two and Hiro walk through the sakura. Zero
Two wears a formal pistil outfit that Kokoro lent her and Hiro compliments her.
She asks if he remembers their promise to marry and he says he does. They spin
around in the petals while smiling and laughing. As the wedding begins, Hiro and
the other parasites ring their bells as Mitsuru and Kokoro walk together as well
as throwing petals.\nHiwever, the wedding is interrupted by the 9\u2019s and an
APE assault team, who have come to take Kokoro and Mitsuru away for
re-indoctrination. Hiro and Goro quickly surrender, and Hiro calls out to Zero
Two as she is beaten down by the 9\u2019s. Afterwards, the parasites sit sadly
around the yard. Hiro thinks that it's like the Garden and they're not allowed
any happiness. As they pack, Hiro wonders where they were taken and if they'll
come back. The cargo ship comes and picks them up.\nA couple of weeks pass. At
the Bird Nest, the squad receives a message and they then reunite with Kokoro
and Mitsuru. Hiro apologizes for causing them trouble because he was the one who
suggested the wedding. But both of them are confused, asking what a wedding is
and have no recollection of the ceremony or each other. Zero Two tells Hiro that
their memories have been altered, just like what happened to them.\nHiro
narrates how they realize they will have to fight for their destiny because they
are at the end of their rope.\n\nEpisode 19\nGoro says that Mitsuru and Kokoro
were implanted with fake memories. Ichigo wonders if their memories are lost
forever. Futoshi asks if what they did warranted their memories being erased.
Zorome says that Papa has his reasons. Miku asks if he's serious and Ikuno says
they destroyed everything about the wedding they'd worked so hard for. Zorome
says that they've only had Papa their whole lives. Miku says she thought he was
better than that. Hiro walks up and Ichigo asks about Zero Two. He says she just
needs some final tune-ups. He tells the group that he's thinking of directly
asking Papa to return them to normal.\nLooking at Papa and the other council via
monitor, Hiro asks that Misturu and Kokoro's memories be returned. Papa refuses
and says that they removed the unnecessary information and there is no way to
return them. The rest of the parasites are distressed and the Vice Chairman says
that what they're doing is a severe breach of protocol and would normally be
punished, but they'll let it off with a mere mention on their record. He says to
return to their waiting quarters. Futoshi demands that they apologize. Zorome
asks how many klaxosaurs they have to kill before they can become adults. They
don't answer and Zorome asks what they're living for. Hiro says that they took
away Zero Two and his precious memories as well as Kokoro and Mitsuru's. He says
they can't see him as their Papa and to set them free once the battle is over.
Papa agrees, as long as they fulfill their duties in next mission. Then they
hang up. Dr. FRANXX tells them to show whether they can become real humans. Hiro
says he saw him in Zero Two's memories and that he can't forgive him before
walking out.\nZero Two sits outside. He stares at her horns and she calls him a
pervert. He smiles and tells her that they made their decision. He holds out his
hand and they walk away. The doctor watches them walk away holding hands.\nHe
narrates that fate is more often cruel, but it can be powerless in the face of
desire. He thinks that she would hate him if she knew.\n\nEpisode 20\nNana's
replacement explains to the parasites that the Star Entity is now under their
control and they'll be booting it up the next day. The FRANXX squads are tasked
with keeping all enemies away from it. Miku asks where Nana is, and she replies
that she is Nana. She introduces herself as Code 007 and says that she's been
appointed the new caretaker of Squad 13. Ichigo asks what the Star Entity is,
and Nana says it's a klaxosaur weapon. Ichigo asks if it's risky, but Nana
simply smiles.\nGorilla says that they don't need to worry and Baboon says that
that's why they modified it for so long. Another says that they're implanting
Strelizia in Star Entity's core. Papa says to Zero Two that it is for that
purpose that they raised her. She is unimpressed, but Hiro grabs her hand and
asks what happens after that. He says that the future will belong to humanity if
they defeat the klaxosaurs. He says they won't call him \"Papa\" anymore and
they'll control their own destiny.\nOn D-Day, at Bird Nest, Vice Chairman says
that APE has always desired peace and prosperity for mankind. Marmoset tells
them to offer all of themselves. Papa says they will finally prevail. 9'\u03b1
watches the squad and becomes annoyed when he sees Zero Two yawn. After the
assembly, the 9's mock squad 13. Zero Two steps forward and says they're all
stronger than them, since they have their eyes on the future. This angers Alpha
and he says that Papa only treats them differently because they're his tools
before they all walk away. The squad is thankful to Zero Two but are interrupted
by a siren. An announcer says that a klaxosaur pack is headed towards Gran
Crevasse. The parasites all head out. Kokoro rubs her finger and Mitsuru says
they were partners, so they should be able to connect.\nAt the Gran Crevasse
ruins, the FRANXX attack the klaxosaur. When Mitsuru compliments Kokoro, he has
a pain in his head when saying her name. Genista struggles, and Kokoro gets the
same pain when saying \"Mitsuru.\"\nHiro, Zero Two, Dr. FRANXX, and Hachi go
down an elevator with Strelizia. Hiro and Zero Two discuss their plans and Zero
Two says she doesn't care as long as they're together. She is about to say
something about the last page of the book, but stops herself. They kiss as they
promise to be together forever. They reach the bottom of Gran Crevasse. Zero Two
hears something coming and they leave. One of the snake klaxosaur break through
the wall and 001 says she won't allow them to do what they wish with their
child. Dr. FRANXX asks if she's there to take back Star Entity, but he says she
can't since she's the last surviving klaxo sapiens. He says he'll operate it
with her, since he always dreamed of it since they met. She suddenly pins him
down and says she needs no partner, but she will use the one he's offered.
Strelizia tries to open a gate, but can't. 001 catches up and pulls Zero Two
out, saying that she's a duplicate that does not realize she is being used by
the invaders. She says she isn't fit to pilot their child before throwing her
out. She kisses Hiro and says he must not be an ordinary human before closing
the door. She says she will devour him and opens the door.\nHiro asks how she
can pilot Strelizia. She says it was originally one of their brethren. Her horns
begin glowing and she sends a message to the pilots. Dr. FRANXX and Hachi hear
as well. Dr. FRANXX says that he found that the klaxosaur split into two forms.
One returned to the earth and became energy. Baboon says that the seal is an
affront. Gorilla says that the magma energy is part of the planet's resources
that saved humans from ruin. 001 says they're selfish and asks if they now want
to steal her child. She says she will not allow it and that the child is a
crystallization of their bonds.\nAlpha tells her not to talk down to Papa. Dr.
FRANXX finishes that the other form consumed that energy and evolved physically
and stopped mingling with one another and lost their intelligence. Hachi asks
what they are, and he says weapons built by the klaxo sapiens. They are composed
of one male and one female klaxo sapiens. The female's soul connected to the
weapon, and the male's soul took root in the core, the cockpit. Hachi says that
it's similar to the FRANXX. Dr. FRANXX says they're an application of the
klaxosaur system. Klaxosaurs that can be piloted by humans genetically modified
to be similar. The parasites realize they'd been kept in the dark.\n001 tells
her child to awaken since they're nearly there. She begins the implanting
process. Papa says that he was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but they have no
choice. Vice Chairman says they wanted to take it and Hringhorni to space as
soldiers. Papa says that, if they can't have it, then it can go down along with
the planet and they will return to their original roles.\nKlaxosaur begin
popping out from the ground and shooting into space. They shoot spaceships in
the sky. Star Entity wakes up and Dr. FRANXX says its beautiful. 001 says that
the humans made her ugly, but it's okay. She says a long time ago, when they
were attacked by invaders from the expanse of space, they fought and drove them
off and then holed up in the earth to prepare. They shoot at a VIRM fleet. They
shoot back and 001 says that she won't let them touch their planet. It shoots
back and destroys it. Papa says its futile and she asks what VIRM did to their
child. The chairman and vice chairman's masks fall and the vice chairman says
that Star Entity is a mass of life that could disturb the universe's peace. Papa
says that if the klaxosaur princess took over the implanting process, they
programmed it to explode. They say that the planet will explode and leave
nothing behind. Papa says that they'll take them to eternal paradise.\nZero Two
continues to walk staggering and says she'll keep her promise to
Hiro.\n\nEpisode 21\nVice Chairman announces that it is VIRM's will for star
energy, which is a mass of life that could disturb the universe's peace. Papa
says that if the klaxosaur princess took over the implanting process, they
programmed it to explode. The other members of the counsel are confused and Papa
explains that they have assimilated several lifeforms from all over the universe
and helped them break free of the shells of their bodies. Vice Chairman says
that the time has come for humans to embrace their evolution. They say that
there exists a form of pleasure that is gentle and perpetual that they will
experience. The three fall to the ground.\nHiro curses as 001 struggles. He
connects to her consciousness. He asks if she's been alone since humanity
existed. Zero Two walks along looking for Hiro. The other parasites watch as
VIRM kills other parasites. They wonder who they should be fighting.\nDr. FRANXX
says that the detonation stalled once Hiro connected, the explosion is triggered
by stampede mode. Zero Two says that he bought them some time before
collapsing.\nThe parasites wonder what they should do and worry about what the
announcement said. They agree to return to Gran Crevasse to see for
themselves.\n001 says that VIRM got her and that it's no use. Hiro asks about
VIRM and how long she'd been alive. 001 says that it has been more than sixty
million years. They inhabited Earth as an advanced civilization. One day, VIRM
arrived. They were a group mind with no physical bodies, and they wanted them to
cast aside their bodies and join. During war, they forged themselves into
immortal weapons and evolved into Klaxosaurs. By the time they fought off VIRM,
fighting and warfare were all that remained of their civilization and they lost
their ability to procreate. The enemy they fought off was VIRM's vanguard. To
prepare for their return, they went underground and the weak turned themselves
into energy, and the strong combined to evolve into even stronger weapons.\nZero
Two wakes up and says that 001 called her a fake. Dr. FRANXX says that 001 is
the sole survivor of the klaxo sapiens, and she is her clone. She was created to
operate Star Entity on behalf of the human race. He says that she was the only
success. He created the 9's using her cells too, but they didn't inherit the
Klaxosaur blood. She says that she's going to save Hiro and she doesn't care
about the rest. Dr. FRANXX says he'll go as well.\nAs Squad 13 continues, they
run into the 9's. They command them to return and continue to follow Papa's
orders. They kill more klaxosaur, but are attacked and killed by VIRM.\nThe
FRANXX break though and they go to help the two. Ikuno and Futoshi clear a path.
Ikuno's turns grey. They let Zero Two go alone with Ichigo and Goro.\n001 and
Hiro continue to struggle. He relates to their want to fight but feels that he
wasn't really living when he only wanted to fight.\nHringhorni begins flying.
Alpha asks Papa to say something. Dr. FRANXX and Zero Two continue as they stay
to fight VIRM. Dr. FRANXX sacrifices his arm to the door, as it contains 001's
cells. Though he wanted them to turn him into a klaxosaur. The snake allows zero
Two to ride. She asks him if he took her to Plantation 13 to reunite her with
Hiro. He says he wasn't expecting them to rekindle what they had and it was just
a whim. Smiling, she thanks him for creating her and helping her meet Hiro.
After she goes, he wonders how she became so human.\nAs they break through the
wall, the snake klaxosaur dies. She opens the door to Strelizia and tries to
revive Hiro. She finds out that he's covered in blood and that they'd run out of
time. Her horns break free and her skin turns red and she kisses him. 001 gives
the rest of her strength to them. She stakes the planet on them.\nThe two
reunite under a tree after keeping their promise. They kiss and the bomb
disintegrates. It breaks their program and begins attacking VIRM. Dr. FRANXX
finds her beautiful before a rock kills him. VIRM takes their lance and
withdraws saying that they will bring back their army.\nPanting, Hiro smiles and
says to Zero Two that they did it. She doesn't respond, and her face is lifeless
as her horn crumbles.\n\nEpisode 22\nHiro takes care of Zero Two while she is in
a catatonic state and remembers when Strelizia flew into space with the
klaxosaurs after the battle was over. He tries to feed her but she doesn\u2019t
move. He is then confused when he notices a mysterious cut on her arm. Squad 13
begins attempting to grow crops in the fields to survive but grow concerned when
they realize their rations are limited and they no longer have water and energy
maintenance. Hiro leaves in the middle of the meeting and a concerned Ichigo
asks him to tell her anything that is bothering him. He later finds more cuts on
Zero Two\u2019s body and grows alarmed.\nThe next day, Hiro goes to work in the
fields although he is exhausted from taking care of Zero Two. Goro asks him to
sit for the day but Hiro declines. Then, everyone sees a VIRM and klaxosaur
crash into the ground after killing each other and then more klaxosaur ships fly
into space. Hiro hears Miku panic when Kokoro collapses. Hiro is present in the
infirmary when the new Nana announces Kokoro is pregnant. In the hallway,
Mitsuru, who realizes he is the father of the baby but is torn between the
choices of abortion or keeping the baby, asks Hiro on which choice is the right
one. However, Hiro says he doesn\u2019t know because he doesn\u2019t even know
what is right or wrong anymore.\nHiro goes to Zero Two\u2019s room and finds it
empty. He searches for her and finds her roaming the hallway, looking at the
sky. The next day, she goes missing again and Hiro searches frantically for her.
Goro tries telling him about the dire situation tegarding the crops until Hiro
finally spots Zero Two standing in the rain outside. He leaves Goro behind to
reach Zero two as she looks aimlessly at the sky. He takes her back to her room,
where he finds the last page of Zero Two\u2019s story has no drawing and he
realizes she deliberately left it blank because she foresaw they would part ways
one day. As his horns make contact with hers, Hiro realizes that Zero Two\u2019s
mind is with Strelizia and she is battling the VIRM.\nHiro meets with Hachi to
find a functional spacecraft that can take him to Strelizia\u2019s location.
They are able to locate a klaxosaur Mothership that is still functional and Hiro
devises a plan to rescue her. He goes to the squad to tell them what he plans to
do and Zero Two\u2019s circumstances. However, they oppose his plan because it
is a suicide mission and he is likely to get killed. Hiro acknowledges he will
probably die and he respects how they feel but, because Zero Two kept her end of
their promise, he intends to do the same thing. He then leaves the room. Goro
stops him and berates him for disregarding everyone\u2019s feelings and going
off to die while everyone who cares about him is struggling to survive. Hiro
replies he understands but he also wants them to understand how he feels and he
can\u2019t just leave Zero Two behind. Goro argues once more that Hiro is
risking his relationship with everyone by going off to die and simply asking
them to understand. Hiro replies that if Zero Two won\u2019t smile at him, he
might as well be dead. Angry, Goro punches Hiro, who is unfazed. Hiro later
cuddles next to Zero Two.\nThe next morning, Hiro is about to leave when he is
met by Squad 13, Nana, and Hachi. Hiro asks them where they are going and Ichigo
says they are going to help him bring Zero Two back. Zorome and Futoshi add they
personally want revenge against VIRM for trying to kill them or letting them
die. The 9\u2019s also offer their assistance to fulfill their duties and intend
to die in space. Goro says he accepts Hiro\u2019s decision and he won\u2019t
fight it anymore, and now they are even. He adds that they all have chosen their
own path so Hiro can\u2019t fight either, moving Hiro to tears. Mitsuru
approaches Hiro and they exchange words.\n\nEpisode 23\nMitsuru tells Hiro that
he will be staying behind and Hiro acknowledges he has chosen to stay for Kokoro
and the baby\u2019s sake. Squad 13 and the 9\u2019s fly into space with their
FRANXX while the klaxosaurs and VIRM battle. Hiro is amazed he was able to
connect with Alpha, who says the 9\u2019s can be both pistol and stamen. Hiro
feels like he with Zero Two and Alpha says that\u2019s because he is her
clone.\nAfter returning to the ship, Goro and Ichigo meet with Hiro, who is
looking at a photo, and they all reaffirm their goal to rescue Zero Two.
Persuaded by Ichigo, Goro apologizes for hitting him and Hiro laughs and nudges
Goro, saying it\u2019s fine. They spot a VIRM fleet within Mars\u2019 orbit and
surrounding Strelizia. Hiro and Alpha head straight into the battle while the
others follow behind as backup. As a fleet forms a barricade to prevent them
from getting closer to Strelizia, Argentea clashes with them to create an
opening for Hiro and Alpha to pass through. They finally reach where Strelizia
is and see the entrance. But they are cornered by a massive VIRM and are unable
land a direct hit on it due to its size. Alpha ejects Hiro into Strelizia and
tells Hiro he learned a bit of what it means to be human but his home is the
battlefield and asks Hiro tell Zero Two \u201cHi\u201d for him before self
destructing and killing the VIRM. Hiro makes his way to the cockpit and sits in
it while recalling his promise to be with Zero Two. Her consciousness awakens
and Hiro, realizing it is her, asks her to devour him. He enters her
consciousness and finds that her mind is filled with pages from her story. She
tells him to stay away from her and they can\u2019t be together because he needs
to be human. Hiro says he wanted to see her and he wants to be with her.\nHiro
finally meets with Zero Two and reaffirms his decision to stay with her because
they promised to be together forever. She tells him to stay away from her and
she is fine with being alone. He calls her a liar and says if so then why is the
last page of her picture book left blank. He offers her his hand so they can
rewrite the story together. She accepts and they embrace while he vows to never
let her go.\nZero Two merges with Strelizia, becoming Strelizia True Apus. She
effortlessly destroys the VIRM fleet. A Warp Gate opens and Hiro and Zero Two
announce they will be going through it and leave the solar system. Squad 13 asks
why they are leaving rather than heading back to Earth. Hiro says Strelizia and
the gate are linked, which means neither she nor him can stop the process, and
the gate will close soon anyway. Ichigo begs for a reason why they have to
leave, and Zero Two replies \u201cto end this war\u201d. Ichigo suggests they
all go but Hiro says only Strelizia can withstand going through the gate and
because the next fleet will be larger, he and Zero Two need to take them by
surprise. Goro asks Hiro if he will come back but Hiro doesn\u2019t respond.
Ichigo says she won\u2019t allow them but, by leader\u2019s orders, they better
come back alive. Goro agrees. Hiro and Zero Two promise to come back as they
take a Klaxosaur Bomb and enter the gate, which closes as soon as they pass
through. In the cockpit, Hiro looks at the photo, which is the group picture the
squad took before the wedding.\n\nEpisode 24\nAfter 70 days of traveling in
space, Hiro notes how he hasn\u2019t had the need to eat and sleep, and wonders
if he is becoming a full klaxosaur. But he says he is not scared because he
feels he is becoming part of Zero Two. They come across a swarm of VIRM and
proceed to wipe them out.\n783 days since the gate passage, Hiro falls asleep
for a moment and talks to Zero Two about a dream he had in which their friends
were leading normal lives on Earth. He also tells her he had a dream in which
they meet in a distant future but he believes it wasn\u2019t a dream but hope
for them.\nAfter arriving at the VIRM home planet, they are confronted by Papa
and the Vice Chairman, who proceeds to send VIRM soldiers to attack them. Hiro
is knocked unconscious and loses his connection to Zero Two, who impaled by
Hringhorni. Papa and the Vice Chairman say Hiro is unconscious due to the
incompatibility of him being a human and her a klaxosaur. At a disadvantage,
Zero Two pleads for her friends to save Hiro.\nBack on Earth, Squad 13 realizes
Zero Two\u2019s body can serve as a link to her and Hiro in space, and they join
hands to send their thoughts to the two. Their voices reach them and Hiro says
he hears all of their voices, including the revelation that Kokoro and Mitsuru
have a daughter whom they named Ai because, as her name means \u2018love\u2019,
a word Hiro and Zero Two taught them, they want her to inherit the bond Hiro
shares with Zero Two. Zero Two credits him for how their lives turned out as it
was proof of his desire to live but he believes he caused them trouble. She says
it was because of his desire to live and how special he is to her, as they met
by chance, are bound by a kiss, and are attracted to each other by nature. She
convinces him to help her once more. He is able to reconnect with Zero Two,
becoming one as the Jian and the Strelizia True Apus reverting back to the
Strelizia Iron Maiden to take control of Hringhorni and push the Klaxosaur bomb
into the VIRM planet. Knowing they will die when it detonates, they profess
their love to each other. The bomb explodes, destroying the planet and freeing
the souls kept in the planet by the VIRM, though Papa and the Vice Chairman
survive and vow to return at the peak of their evolution. Hiro and Zero
Two\u2019s souls begin making the long journey back to Earth.\nEveryone on Earth
sees the explosion and realize Hiro and Zero Two won the battle but sacrificed
themselves, which saddens them. Over the next eight years, the memory of Hiro
and Zero Two remains on everyone\u2019s minds. Ichigo completes Zero Two\u2019s
story book and all the children are taught to read it to honor their memory.
Squad 13 reunites at a cherry blossom tree and thank Hiro and Zero Two for
teaching them about life, love, and humanity and for giving them a chance to
live normal lives.\nA thousand years later, a young boy who resembles Hiro meets
a young girl who looks like Zero Two. It is revealed they are the reincarnations
of Hiro and Zero Two, and they begin a new romance once
again.\n\nRelationships\nZero Two\nHiro first met Zero Two when she was skinny
dipping in the lake of Mistilteinn. He was horrified to see a naked girl for the
first time but she was undeterred and found his reaction to be amusing. She
teased him by calling him a pervert because he didn\u2019t realize he was
holding her underwear. He then confided in her about his inability to pilot and
he has no purpose in life. Zero Two forces herself into him, telling him he can
make a future by himself, even if he has to take it by force. Despite that
others discriminate her for her horns, he found that they are alluring. When
they meet again, Hiro is determined to pilot a FRANXX to give his existence a
purpose and offers to help Zero Two pilot Strelizia, despite the rumors in which
her partners die after three rides. Compelled, she declares him as her
\u2018darling\u2019 and kisses him, which activates Strelizia.\nSince then, Zero
Two becomes fascinated with Hiro and prefers to spend as much time with him as
possible, even when she was not an official member of Squad 13. Hiro found her
rebellious and alluring behavior to be bizarre and awkward but deep down, he
felt drawn to her. Although his friends insist he must stay away from Zero Two
because of the rumors, he refuses and decides to keep piloting with her even if
he dies. Before his third ride, Zero Two offers him a chance to back out of it
but he still chooses to ride with her. During the ride, he almost succumbs to
the effects until he witnesses Zero Two fight in stampede mode and hurt herself
to fight a Gutenberg klaxosaur. Hiro miraculously survives and embraces her,
telling her that he is her partner. This allows them to reconnect and kill the
klaxosaur. Afterwards they become official partners.\nZero Two treats Hiro more
as a lover, though this embarrasses him due to his lack of knowledge on
interpersonal relationships and sentimentality. By Episode 11, the first signs
of cracks in their relationship surface. Hiro offers to listen to her problems
and encourages her to be open with him but she refuses, saying they can
communicate better while piloting Strelizia. She later tells Hiro they will
always be together. In episode 12, Zero Two becomes increasingly distant with
Hiro to the point of ignoring him when he talks to her. Hiro confronts her,
telling her that, after watching Goro and Futoshi struggle with their feelings
for Ichigo and Kokoro respectively, he realizes he Ioves her. She pushes him to
the ground and partially undresses while offering to show him what comes after a
kiss. While kissing him, he resists and says that\u2019s not what he means. She
is indifferent to him afterwards.\nGradually, Zero Two becomes more hostile than
ever, even towards Hiro. In the middle of such a fight, Hiro connects deeply
with the consciousness of Zero Two and catches a glimpse of the memory that was
their childhood. A young Hiro had just witnessed a girl with red skin and horns
being pulled to another room by an Adult. Curious, he persued her and was
petrified to see her being used as a lab rat, subject to torture, etc. Unwilling
to watch her suffer, Hiro broke her out of her cell and together, they hid in
the forest. Hiro was kind enough to look after her, talk to her, gave her sweet
and even tended to her wounds. Time passes by, and one day, Hiro and the girl
rested under a white tree. Hiro promises the girl that he will be her Darling.
Overcame with joy, she broke into tears. But their happiness was cut short when
they were arrested and brainwashed. Hiro then woke up in Strelizia, tears
welling down his face. That girl was Zero Two, who is currently out of control,
beating up her teammates. Hiro confronted her. Tears flowed down both their
faces.\nAs Hiro is forcibly separated from his partner, he tries to escape the
hospital room he is locked in by the rest of the squad to see Zero Two, but only
finds a ruined empty bedroom in Mistilteinn. He comes to realize she also went
out to look for him in the hospital. However, when he arrives in his room again,
he finds an outraged Zero Two holding Ichigo by the neck, while the rest of
Squad 13 lies unconcious. Ichigo is then thrown to the ground. Ichigo tells Hiro
to run. Zero Two, with a devious grin, invites Hiro to \"talk lots and lots\".
Hiro scolds her for being such a monster. causing Zero Two not to despise him,
but to understand the damage she's made and how unfair she's been to the one she
holds dearest. Feeling like she needs to be punished for her misdeeds, a
depressed Zero Two consents to leave Cerasus and meet the Nines for the battle
of Gran Crevasse, this time by the side of disposable stamens, leaving as Hiro
cries. When he tries once more to retrieve her, Ichigo stops him, confessing her
love for him while Hiro instead pays attention to the sky as Zero Two's plane
leaves the area.\nSeeing Zero Two fighting alone prompts Hiro to finally decide
he is not going to abandon Zero Two, recklessly charging through the battlefield
in a Training unit, armed with nothing but a wooden board. He fell. Blood slowly
oozed from his forehead, but he was not going to give up just yet. Goro, seeing
his efforts, allows him a first class seat inside Delphinium with Ichigo.
Together, they reached Strelitzia. Hiro managed to make his way into the cockpit
and consoles Zero Two. In return, Zero Two reciprocates Hiro feelings towards
her, resulting in Strelizia \"evolving\". They then annihilated a super Lehman
class Klaxosaur while screaming each other's name out loud.\nFrom then onwards,
they began a romantic relationship and reaffirmed their promise to get married
once they reach adulthood. Zero Two begins drawing a story book based a book
from her childhood, \u201cThe Prince and and the Beast\u201d, which she feels is
similar to her relationship with Hiro. They become increasingly devoted and
affectionate to each other, and spend as much time with each other as possible.
They become so devoted to each other to the point they back each other up
against APE\u2019s treatment towards the squad, and they desire to lead new
lives beyond fighting. \nDuring the battle with VIRM, Zero Two risks her life to
save Hiro from the Klaxosaur Princess and her consciousness merges with
Strelizia to continue fighting with VIRM while Hiro stays behind to be safe.
Hiro, however, rushes to save her and she reveals her true motive for leaving
him: so he could remain human because he is becoming a monster like her.
However, he reaffirms his vow to be with her forever and they reconcile as they
symbolically \u2019marry\u2019. After two years of fighting VIRM in space, Hiro
and Zero Two sacrifice themselves and happily die together, promising to meet
again.\nA thousand years later, their souls are reincarnated into two children,
who meet a cherry blossom tree and they ask for each other\u2019s names,
strongly hinting they will rekindle their romance.\n\nIchigo\nIchigo is Hiro's
childhood best friend. He cares a lot about her and Goro compares their
relationship to that of siblings. Hiro admitts that's how he feels as well but
seems to be oblivious to her feelings for him. When Hiro piloted Delphinium with
her, their compatibility was 100%, higher than any other pair. However, their
FRANXX deactivated almost immediately afterwards. When Ichigo kissed him in an
attempt to help awaken his abilities like it did with Zero Two, he felt nothing
but guilt because it was her first kiss and he knew a kiss is supposed to be
shared with someone special. Ichigo, in her anger, retorted he sucked at kissing
which surprises him.\nIn the aftermath, Ichigo told him to forget about it
because he failed to awaken his abilities as he tried apologizing. He still
found it awkward to be around her, although he continued remaining friendly with
her. Goro eventually tells Hiro that Ichigo looks at him as her hero and she
holds romantic feelings for him, which caught Hiro off guard and again made him
feel awkward around her. In turn, Ichigo worries deeply for Hiro as he piloted
with Zero Two despite the risks of doing so, and she secretly felt jealous of
how much attention he was paying to Zero Two. When Hiro almost died during his
third ride, Ichigo broke down crying and blamed herself for not stopping him.
But when he survived, she was so relieved she embraced him.\nAfter Zero Two
leaves the squad for almost killing Hiro and attacking the squad, Hiro attempts
to stop her but Ichigo kissed him and confesses she loves him and wants to be
with him forever. Hiro doesn\u2019t know how to respond but can only think about
Zero Two.\nIchigo continues to try to keep Hiro from seeing Zero Two and
promises to help him pilot with her. However, while Hironis grateful for her
concern, he is distraught at himself for hesitating to see Zero Two and goes to
the battlefield. Ichigo again tries to stop him but Goro intervenes and
convinces her to let Hiro see her. When they connect in Delphinium, Ichigo sees
his mind is full of memories and emotions for Zero Two, causing her to cry and
remark there is no room for her. Although she lashes out at Zero Two for her
behavior, she later admits she is happy for them when they reconcile.\nSince
then, Hiro and Ichigo remained close friends and she no longer holds animosity
towards Zero Two. When Hiro decides to go on a suicide mission to save Zero Two
in space, Ichigo sheds tears but she later decides to support his decision and
help him.\nIchigo mourns Hiro\u2019s death but still believes the two will one
day come back. Eight years after his death, Ichigo remembers the lessons she
learned from Hiro and Zero Two, saying they were more human than anyone
else.\n\nGoro\n Hiro and Goro in their room. \nGoro and Hiro have a good
relationship and grew up together in the Garden. They think of each other like
brothers. Goro is generally the most supportive of Hiro and his endeavors
because he only wants Hiro to find happiness and success. When others tend to
doubt Hiro as a FRANXX pilot, Goro is the one who voices nothing but positive
remarks about how Hiro is a genius and can pull through if he keeps trying.
\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Goro is above voicing his disapproval of Hiro\u2019s
choices if it involves putting his life at stake. This is shown when Goro
learned Hiro was suffering from a lethal tumor on his chest as a result of
piloting with Zero Two. Goro wanted to help him and asked him to not pilot with
her again but Hiro convinced him to keep it a secret because all he wanted was
to fulfill his duties as a parasite even if it meant dying. Goro in turn called
him a fool. However, when Hiro survived his third ride, Goro was greatly
relieved and came to support Hiro piloting with her again, as he saw she made a
positive influence on Hiro. \nThey continued to remain friendly and confidants
until they get into a heated argument in Episode 23. Hiro decided to go to space
to rescue Zero Two despite it being a suicide mission. Goro berates him for
running off to die while everyone else was working hard to survive. Hiro\u2019s
response that he was better off dead without having Zero Two with him provoked
Goro into punching him. However, the next day, the two reconciled. \nTwo years
later, when Hiro and Zero Two sacrifice themselves, Goro mourns the death of his
best friend. \n\n\nZorome\n Hiro and Zorome butt heads. \nZorome and Hiro have
clashing personalities. Zorome often would mock Hiro of his inability to pilot
and start fights with him. Hiro held back from retaliating except in Episode 02,
when they do get into a physical altercation. Zorome and Miku both volunteer to
be the opponents in Hiro\u2019s mock battle because Zorome wanted to beat Hiro
and prove his worthiness.\nAfter Hiro pilots Strelizia with Zero Two and saves
him alongside the rest of the squad, Hiro makes amends with him, and states that
he will try not to be a burden to Zorome and will fight alongside him, which
gained his respect. Despite this, Zorome continued to mock him, although not
with animosity but with amusement.\nOvertime, the two became sincere comrades
and worked together well in the battlefield. After Hiro decided to go to space
to rescue Zero Two, Zorome agrees to go with him but he insists he only wants
revenge against VIRM and not because of him wanting to do it for Hiro. By
Episode 23, the sincerity of their comradeship is shown when Zorome is saddened
by Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s decision to travel trough space to destroy VIRM for
good.\n\nMiku\nLike with Zorome, Hiro shared a distant relationship with Miku,
who also doubted his parasite abilities. However, she showed more concern for
his fate after his initial failure to synchronize with Naomi. She finds
amusement in his awkward relationship with Zero Two and teases him for it. Like
with all his comrades, Hiro treats Miku like a friend and shows concern for her
during battles. She also mourns his death and believes he heard everyone\u2019s
prayers before he died.\n\nFutoshi\nHiro and Futoshi have a typical squadmate
relationship. They are very civil with each other and never have arguments. Hiro
is there to comfort Futoshi after Kokoro breaks off their partnership. Hearing
Futoshi confess he loved Kokoro gradually helps Hiro recognize his own feelings
for Zero Two.\n\nIkuno\nHiro and Ikuno rarely talk to each other but are civil
when in the other\u2019s presence.\n\n\nMitsuru\nMitsuru and Hiro have a
negative relationship. Mitsuru used to look up to Hiro, but finds his inability
to pilot pathetic. He mocks him and seems to have an inferiority complex against
him. He is desperate to prove that he is better than Hiro, stating that he will
even become the stamen of Strelizia because he is able to ride it just as good
as Hiro. However, he is left greatly injured after riding in Strelizia, which
makes him anxiously think about why Hiro can pilot it so well while he can't,
showing his great jealousy of Hiro.\nIt's later revealed that Mitsuru\u2019s
cold attitude towards Hiro stemmed from their childhood. Mitsuru once promised
Hiro that they would ride a Franxx together. But, due of Dr FRANXX wiping the
latter's memory, Hiro forgot about that promise. Mitsuru view this as an act of
betrayal and hated Hiro ever since. Hiro later remembered his promise in episode
13 and confronted Mitsuru in episode 14, apologizing for what had happened.
Mitsuru said he had forgotten about that already.\nWith the misunderstanding
cleared up, the two have become more civil and open with each other, and Hiro
helps Mitsuru realize his feelings for Kokoro. They have a conversation about
Mitsuru\u2019s feelings for Kokoro and Mitsuru even tells Hiro how glad he is
that they were able to talk like this after a long time. Hiro further encourages
them to get married but Papa\u2019s decision to erase their memories as
punishment provoked Hiro into confronting and clashing with Papa. However, when
Mitsuru learns Kokoro is pregnant with his child, he turns to Hiro for advice
but Hiro, lost in concern for Zero Two, can\u2019t give him an answer.\nMitsuru,
with the other parasites, sends his thoughts to Hiro and Zero Two. He tells Hiro
that he and Kokoro named their child Ai because it means \u2018love\u2019, a
word they were never taught but learned from Hiro and they wanted her to inherit
the bond Hiro shares with Zero Two. After Hiro\u2019s sacrifice, Mitsuru mourns
his death.\n\nKokoro\nHiro and Kokoro have a typical squadmate relationship but
they get along relatively well. She treats Hiro kindly and shows concern for him
when he has trouble connecting with a FRANXX. She also looks up to him for being
a genius and working hard to prove his worthiness as a parasite. Hiro helps
Kokoro and Mitsuru officialize their relationship by encouraging them to get
married and it is Papa\u2019s decision to erase their memories as punishment
that finally provoked Hiro to confront and clash with Papa.\nAfter Hiro\u2019s
sacrifice, Kokoro breaks into tears but thanks him for saving the
planet.\n\nNaomi\n Naomi says goodbye. \nHis former partner while training to
become Parasites. When tested in their ability to connect they failed. Naomi was
expelled, and Hiro chose to leave, despite HQ giving him the rare chance to
remain in hopes of getting a partner that is compatible with him. Naomi cares
for Hiro enough that she gets upset that he chose to leave Plantation 13 along
with her. When they're meant to get on a transport to leave, she prevents him
from getting on board by throwing her suitcase at him. The last thing she tells
him is that she likes the name he gave her, and that she hopes he finds a good
partner.\nHiro is relieved when he learns she survived the klaxosaur attack and
had gone under medical treatment.\nShe appears again in Episode 6, in the moment
when Hiro almost dies, reminding him that his partner (Zero Two) needs him, also
that he is lying to himself upon the fact that he is satisfied and that he
thinks had done his best.\nShe reappears in episode 24 and later mourns
Hiro\u2019s death.\n\nDr. FRANXX\nDr. Franxx once commented that: \"That boy
(Hiro) might be the one to fulfill Zero Two's request\". But, upon meeting him
personally, he warns Hiro that if he wants to be with Zero Two forever, he
musn't let her consume him. Hiro was amazed to meet Dr. Franxx and was surprised
to learn he was the creator of the FRANXX. Dr. Franxx was also interested in
Hiro as being the only stamen to survive his third ride with Zero Two.\nIn midst
of a heated rage-full attack from Zero Two, Hiro deeply connects with Zero
Two\u2019s consciousness and sees memories of her being subjected to inhumane
experiments, which left a child Hiro horrified and provoked him to help her
escape. After the two were captured, Dr. Franxx erased their memories and he
returned Hiro to the Garden.\nDuring the Gran Crevasse siege, they had a chat.
Dr. Franxx remarks about how Zero Two is such a marvelous creation, yet is
always so lonely, like a Klaxosaur. Hiro objected, saying that she's human.
Intrigued, the doctor turns around to look at Hiro. He says that he had thought
she (Zero Two) may have finally found a partner as Hiro prepares to leave for
Zero Two.\nLater, Hiro confronts Dr. Franxx about his role in erasing his and
Zero Two\u2019s memories. Hiro expresses his anger at him for the horrific
experiments he did to Zero Two and Hiro says he will never forgive him for that
before walking away.\nAfter the Klaxosaur Princess forcibly connects with Hiro
and seriously injures Zero Two, Dr. Franxx offers advice to her to save Hiro
before he is consumed by the princess. Although Dr. Franxx says he it was never
his intention to reunite the two, he is simply trying to atone for his sins for
what he did to Zero Two and only she and Hiro can create a
miracle.\n\nPapa\nAlong with APE's council (Known as Landmark Club, or Seven
Sages), Papa refers to Hiro as the \"Special Specimen\". Like all the parasites
and adults, Hiro was loyal to Papa and states his sole purpose in life was to
protect Papa and the adults. However, after regaining his lost memories, this
purpose began to diminish and Hiro slowly recognizes Papa held neither
compassion or interest in the parasites other than using them as tools for
warfare.\nIt is when Kokoro and Mitsuru\u2019s memories were erased for wanting
to get married and have a child that Hiro began to openly rebel against Papa. He
later confronted Papa, saying he can no longer see him as Squad 13\u2019s Papa
for taking away their happiness and demanded he relieve them of their duties,
which Papa agreed to do in exchange for the squad\u2019s cooperation in the
final battle. Hiro agreed but reaffirmed the squad will decide it\u2019s own
destiny.\nAfter Papa reveals he is actually a VIRM who has been using the
children as tools against the klaxosaurs, Hiro no longer has any loyalty or
regards for Papa, especially when Papa leaves the children on their own to
potentially die after the parasites turn against him and help the klaxosaurs
force Papa and the VIRM to retreat into space.\nIn the final battle, Papa
suggests all life forms merge with VIRM to eliminate hate and discrimination but
Hiro rejected this. After Hiro and Zero Two sacrifice themselves, Papa is still
alive and vows to face them again at the peak of evolution.\n\n001\nHiro and the
Klaxosaur Princess were connected temporarily in Strelizia and she considers him
as no ordinary human after looking at his small horns and some klaxosaur blood
in his veins. He resisted her and considered her as a monster but she
overpowered him and he would have died if Zero Two had not arrived and saved
him. Seeing the depth of love between the two, the princess decides to leave the
fate of the world in their hands and frees Hiro.\n\nAi\nHiro never meets Ai, who
is Kokoro and Mitsuru\u2019s daughter, as she was born during the time he was
fighting in space. It is Ai who is indirectly responsible for helping Hiro and
Zero defeat VIRM when she has an intuition that they are in danger and her
repeating \u201cdarling\u201d, a word she didn\u2019t know, convinced the others
something was wrong and they sent their prayers to Hiro and Zero Two. When he
hears Kokoro and Mitsuru say they had a baby girl and her name means love, a
word Hiro taught them, Hiro regains consciousness and is able to reconnect with
Zero Two to destroy the VIRM planet. Although he never met her, Hiro cared for
her deeply enough to sacrifice his life to protect her.\n\nEtymology\nHiro's
nickname may use some of the numeral's readings from his real name \"Code:016\"
(pronounced zero-ichi-roku): hi from 1 (\u4e00\u3064, hitotsu) and ro from 6
(\u516d, roku).\n\nAppearances\n\n\nDARLING in the FRANXX

you!\"\u2014(To Zero Two) [13]\n\"I'm your partner. I'm not going to leave you
alone.\"\u2014(To Zero Two) [5]\n\"Yeah. Once we get out of here... I want to be
with you forever too. And then I'll be your Da...\"\u2014(To Zero Two)
[3]\n\"The picture book... You were the girl with the picture book back then,
weren't you?\"\u2014(To Zero Two) [3]\n\"This world is surely much, much larger
than we can ever imagine! We couldn't do it back then, but this time, for sure,
let's go to the outside world together! Zero Two... Together, we are
one.\"\u2014(To Zero Two) [14]\n\"I can't leave Zero Two alone. We made a
promise. Even if we were torn apart, we'd go to get the other, no matter how
far. Zero Two kept up her end of the promise, so I can't just sit here and do
nothing. Absolutely not!\"\u2014(To Goro) [6]\n\"I hereby vow to never let you
go.\"\u2014(To Zero Two) [15]\nTrivia\nHiro's name is a reference to the word
\"Hero\", which is pronounced as \u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc (h\u012br\u014d) in
Japanese. This fits him since he was considered a hero and role model among the
Children in the Garden. Goro at one point even states that Hiro has always been
Ichigo's hero.\nHiro gave everyone in Squad 13 their names, except for
Ikuno.\nDespite being unable to pilot in the beginning, Hiro has the record of
piloting 4 differents FRANXX's: Unknown FRANXX with Naomi, Strelizia,
Delphinium, 9 Model.\nHiro also has the record of the largest variety of
partners: Zero Two (official partner; Strelizia), Naomi (former partner), Ichigo
(temporary partner; Delphinium), 001 (temporary partner; Strelizia) & 9'\u03b1
(temporary partner; 9 Model).\nHiro is terrible at art, shown when he drew a
picture of the prince for Zero Two\u2019s picture book and she burst out
laughing upon seeing it. Ichigo also states he sucked when she sees the
drawing.\nHiro enjoys reading, as he read The Golden Bough and understood its
concepts as a small child and asked for an illustrated guide as an annual gift
from Papa.\nHiro\u2019s English voice actor, Matt Shipman, and Ichigo\u2019s
English voice actress, Brittany Lauda, are married in real
life.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 Episode 02\n\n\u2191
